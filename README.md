Summer 2015 - Coding Space 
====================================================

My name is Luke Licursi. I am currently looking for something productive and helpful to do with my 2015 summer.
I am a student at the University of Toronto in the Engineering Science Program.
I would like stay mentally active by practicing the skills I have been taught over my first two year this summer. 

I have experiance with Python, C, Matlab, Verilog, Assembly, R, and I am very eager to learn more. 

For the Summer of 2015 I plan on working on different projects, which will keep my coding abilities sharp. 
Whether that be personal projects, challenges, working with friends on a project or with a third party.
